# Search for Attractions in Singapore, powered by Elasticsearch

## üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why did I build this?
What better way to understand concepts than to implement it in a project! Elasticsearch is specifically designed for high-speed, real-time search and retrieval of large amounts of data. In order to gain the ability to build robust search functionality into any future work, I decided to embark on a simple project that puts what I've learnt to practice. 

## üíª User Interface built using React.js and Bootstrap
